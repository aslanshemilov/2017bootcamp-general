- `<iostream>` . . . is a C++ library (input/output)

- `main()` . . . program (function)

- `return 0` . . . returns the return value 0 to main (all ok)

- source code can be freely formated, i.e., it can contain an arbitary number of spaces and empty lines (white space) â†’ useful for visual structuring

- comments are started with `//` - everything after it (in the same line) is ignored, C has only `/* comment */` for comment blocks

- `cout` . . . output on screen/terminal (C++)

- `<<` . . . output/concatenate operator (C++)

- `string "Hello world!"` must be set in quotation marks

- `endl` . . . manipulator: new line and stream flush (C++)

- `a block` several instructions which are hold together by curly braces
